        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming or scripting language that allows you to implement complex functions in web pages, every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to see, it displays timely content updates, interactive maps , 2D / 3D graphics animation, video player scrolling, etc., you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
        </p>
        <h2>What does JavaScript do?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the programming language that you must use to add interactive features to your website, (for example, games, events that occur when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic style effects, animation, and much more. plus).
        </p>
        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
        <p>
            The DOM is the structure of objects that the browser generates when a document is loaded and can be altered using Javascript to dynamically change the contents and appearance of the page.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a Web APIs?</h2>
        <p>
            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs available in programming languages ​​that allow developers to create complex functionalities in a simple way. They abstract the more complex code to provide a more user-friendly syntax instead.
        </p>
        <h2>They mention as a minimum 5 examples of Apis Web</h2>
        <p>
            Instagram, GitHub, Wikipedia, ChatCompose and Google Translate
        </p>
        <h2>What does JavaScript do on your web page?</h2>
        <p>
            You can do almost anything with JavaScript. You can start with little things like carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button presses. Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) Third party APIs Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to your HTML so you can quickly build and publish sites and applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Give an example of how to add JavaScript to your web page</h2>
        <p>
            You can do this by using the script script tag that should wrap all the JS code you write. JS code can be added:

between head tags
between body tags
Depending on where you add the JavaScript code in your HTML file, the load will be different. It is generally recommended to add it in the head section so that it remains separate from the content of your HTML file. But placing it inside body can help improve the loading speed, as the website content will load faster, and only after that will the JavaScript be processed.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the two ways to add JavaScript code to your website?</h2>
        <p>
            You can do this using the script / script tag that should wrap all the JS code you write. JS code can be added: between head tags between body tags
        </p>
        <h2>How do you comment the code in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            Inline comments that start with a double slash: //, and multi-line comments, that start with / * and end with * /.
        </p>
        <h2>How is a variable declared and what are its main characteristics?</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on how they are measured, the variables may be qualitative or quantitative. Those that express different characteristics or qualities will be qualitative; and they will be quantitative when expressing numerical arguments. Qualitative variations may be classified as: Ordinal or quasi-quantitative.
        </p>
        <h2>How is a condition declared and what are its main characteristics?</h2>
        <p>
            Flow control
Block
A statement block is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of braces.
break
Terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers control of the program to the next statement in the terminated statement.
continue
It ends the execution of the statements within the current iteration of the current loop, and continues the execution of the loop with the next iteration.
Empty
An empty statement is used to provide a "no statement", even though the JavaScript syntax expected one.
if ... else
Executes a statement if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement can be executed.
switch
Evaluates an expression, matching the value of the expression to a case clause and executes the statements associated with that case.
throw
Throw a user-defined exception.
try ... catch
Marks a block of statements to be tried (try) and specifies a response, in case an exception is thrown.
Declarations
var
Declare a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let
Declare a local block scope variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
const
Declare a read-only constant.
Features
function
Declare a function with the specified parameters.
function *
Function generators allow you to write iterators more easily.
 async function
Declare an asynchronous function with the specified parameters.
return
Specifies the value to be returned by a function.
class
Declare a class.
Iterations
do ... while
Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after the statement is executed, resulting in the specified statement being executed at least once.
for
Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop.
 for each ... in
Iterates a specified variable over all the values ​​of the object's properties. For each distinct property, a specified statement is executed.
for ... in
Iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, instructions can be executed.
for ... of
Iterates over iterable objects (including array, array-like objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.
while
Creates a loop that executes the specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.
Others
debugger
Invokes any available debugging functionality. If no debugging functionality is available, this instruction has no effect.
export
Used to allow a signed script to provide properties, functions and objects to other signed or unsigned scripts. This old Netscape functionality has been removed and will be redefined by the ECMAScript 6 modules.
import
Used to allow a script to import properties, functions and objects from another signed script that has exported its information. This old Netscape functionality has been removed and will be redefined by the ECMAScript 6 modules.
label
Provide a statement with an identifier that you can refer to using a break or continue statement.
 with
Extends the scope string for an instruction.
        </p>
        <h2>How is loop declared and what are its main characteristics?</h2>
        <p>
            A while loop is a flow control statement that allows code to run repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. The for loop provides a concise way to write the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, the condition, and the increment / decrement on one line, thus providing a shorter and easier-to-debug loop structure. The do while loop is similar to the while with the only difference that it checks the condition after executing the statements, and is therefore an example of an Exit Control Loop.
        </p>
        <h2>How is a function declared and what are its main characteristics?</h2>
        <p>
            result_type function_name (parameter_type parameter_name, ...) {
                sentence1;
                sentence2;
                ...
                sentenceN;
             }
             A function cannot modify any variable defined in the workspace, unless it appears in its output list.
        </p>
        <h2>How is an object declared and what are its main characteristics?</h2>
        <p>
            Objects correspond to things found in the real world. For example, an online shopping system could have objects such as: shopping cart, customer, and product. 
            Once the mold is defined, we can use it again to create as many objects as we want that behave in the same way as the one we have defined.
        </p>
        <h2>How can you read an event with JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            Each XHTML element has its own list of possible events that can be assigned to it. The same type of event (for example, clicking the left mouse button) can be defined for several XHTML elements and the same XHTML element can have different events associated with it.

The name of the events is constructed using the prefix on, followed by the English name of the action associated with the event. Thus, the event of clicking an element with the mouse is called onclick and the event associated with the action of moving the mouse is called onmousemove.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What events can we read with JavaScript mention them and describe them?</h2>
        <p>
            onblur An element loses focus button, input, label, select, textarea, body
                onchange An element has been modified input, select, textarea
                onclick Click and release the mouse All elements
                ondblclick Click twice in a row with the mouse All elements
                onfocus An element gets focus button, input, label, select, textarea, body
                onkeydown Press and hold a key Form elements and body
                onkeypress Pressing a key Form elements and body
                onkeyup Release a pressed key Form elements and body
                onload Page fully loaded body
                onmousedown Press and hold a mouse button All elements
                onmousemove Move the mouse All elements
                onmouseout The mouse "leaves" the element All elements
                onmouseover The mouse "enters" the element All elements
                onmouseup Release mouse button All items
                onreset Initialize the form form
                onresize Modify the size of the body window
                onselect Select a text input, textarea
                onsubmit Submit form form
                onunload The page is abandoned, for example when closing the browser body

        <h2>How can I convert Strings to Objects?</h2>
        <p>
            If we have a string with a JSON we can transform it into a javaScript object using the JSON function. parse (json) that will return the object corresponding to our JSON.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you use arrays in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            Create an Array

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"]

console.log (fruits.length)
// 2
Copy to Clipboard
Access an Array element by its index

let first = fruits [0]
// Apple

let last = fruits [fruits.length - 1]
// Banana
Copy to Clipboard
Traverse an Array

fruits.forEach (function (element, index, array) {
    console.log (element, index);
})
// apple 0
// Banana 1
Copy to Clipboard
Add an element to the end of an Array

let newLength = fruits.push ('Orange') // Add "Orange" at the end
// ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
Copy to Clipboard
Remove the last element from an Array

let last = fruits.pop () // Remove "Orange" from the end
// ["Apple", "Banana"]
Copy to Clipboard
Add an element to the beginning of an Array

// ["Strawberry", "Apple", "Banana"]
Copy to Clipboard
Remove the first element from an Array

let first = fruits.shift () // Remove "Strawberry" from start
// ["Apple", "Banana"]
Copy to Clipboard
Find the index of an element in the Array

fruits.push ('Strawberry')
// ["Apple", "Banana", "Strawberry"]

let pos = fruits.indexOf ('Banana') // (pos) is the position for short
// 1

2 June 1998 Editorial changes to keep the full specification aligned with the international standard ISO / IEC 16262 Mike Cowlishaw
3 December 1999 Added regular expressions, better handling of strings, new control of declarations, handling of exceptions with try / catch, stricter definition of errors, format for numeric output and other improvements. Mike cowlishaw
4 Abandoned The fourth edition was abandoned due to political differences regarding the complexity of the language. Many proposed features for the fourth edition were completely abandoned; some were proposed for the ECMAScript Harmony edition.
December 5, 2009 Adds "strict mode", a subset intended to provide better error checking and avoid error-prone constructors. It clears up several ambiguities from the third edition, and refines the behavior of "real world" implementations that consistently differ from that specification. It adds some new features, such as getters and setters, a library for JSON support, and a more complete reflection on the properties of objects.11 Pratap Lakshman, Allen Wirfs-Brock
5.1 June 2011 This 5.1 edition of the ECMAScript Standard is fully aligned with the third edition of the international standard ISO / IEC 16262: 2011. Pratap Lakshman, Allen Wirfs-Brock
6 June 201512 The sixth edition adds significant changes to the syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, defining them semantically in the same terms as the strict mode of the ECMAScript 5 edition. Other new features include for / of loops iterators, generators and generator of Python-style expressions, address functions, binary data, collections (maps, sets, weak maps), and proxies (? metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers). Being the first specification “ECMAScript Harmony”, it is also known as “ES6 Harmony”. Allen Wirfs-Brock
June 7, 2016 The seventh edition was a mere update of version 6. It incorporates the Array.prototype.includes () method and the exponential operator (**). Brian terlson
June 8, 2017 The 8th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2017, was finalized in June 2017. [11] It includes async / await constructors, which work using generators and promises. Brian terlson
June 9, 2018 The 9th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2018, includes rest / spread operators for variables (three dots: ... identifier), asynchronous iteration, Promise.prototype.finally () Brian Terlson

        <h2>What is a webSocket?</h2>
        <p>
            WebSocket is a TCP-based network protocol that establishes how data should be exchanged between networks. Since it is a reliable and efficient protocol, it is used by almost all clients. The TCP protocol establishes connections between two communication endpoints, called sockets. In this way, data exchange can occur in both directions.

        <h2>How does JavaScript handle memory?</h2>
        <p>
            These primitives are used by the developer to explicitly allocate and free memory from and to the operating system. At the same time, JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and “automatically” frees it up when they are not used anymore, a process called garbage collection.
